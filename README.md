## Abstract

## Introduction

I am Researching about Sedge Wren. Sedge Wren is a bird found in North
America. Sedge Wren is also known as Cistothorus Stellaris. It is a
passerine bird in the family of Troglodytidae mostly found in wet
grasslands and meadows.These species are summer breeding. They
habitually build their nest as early as May and continues until late
August. In this project, I will focus on the Sedge Wren family on the
United States soil. I will create a graphic map or visual map that shows
the characters of this bird, such as its breeding season from time to
time, where they relocate from time to time, etc. I’ll visualize these
characters on the project.

## Methods

### Data Acquisition

First of all, I attempted to download the data, however, it was a large
dataset, which that case would take more space from my laptop, so I did
not have to request access from the original website of eBird. I went on
the MSUM class share website where the instructor uploaded it
(\\msumstudents.mnstate.edu) to minimize the size of the data.Then I
downloaded it. After the download, I read the data into RStudio (RStudio
Team, 2020). I also read into RStudio an auk package with bird
observations. I installed a cornel lab of ornithology with all the bird
observations of the dataset using the function
(remote::install\_girhub). I used (gridExtra) package from (Baptiste
Auguie 2017), (lubridate) package from (Garrett Grolemund 2011), (psych)
package from (Revelle, W. 2020), (readr, and dplyr) from (Hadley Wickham
2020) .

### Data Preparation

I used (gridExtra) package from (Baptiste Auguie 2017) for graphing and
drawing tables with plots. I used the (lubridate) package from (Garrett
Grolemund 2011) to work with dates basically to smooth the research
during date and time. I figured, I would need a (psych) package from
(Revelle, W. 2020) for psychological studies done by Sedge Wren Species.
Finally, I used “readr” and (dplyr) packages from (Hadley Wickham 2020)
to help me read the data and help me translate my thoughts into codes.
