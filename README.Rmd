## Abstract and introduction

I am Researching about Sedge Wren. Sedge Wren is a bird found in North America. Sedge Wren is also known as Cistothorus Stellaris. It is a passerine bird in the family of Troglodytidae mostly found in wet grasslands and meadows. In this project, I will focus on the Sedge Wren family on the United States soil. I will create a graphic map or visual map that shows the characters of this bird, such as its breeding season from time to time, where they relocate from time to time, etc. These species are summer breeding. They habitually build their nest as early as May and continues until late August. Iâ€™ll visualize these characters on the project.


## Methods --> Data Acquisition --> Results --> Discussion --> Literature Cited --> references

First of all, I attempted to download the data, however, it was a large dataset, which that case would take more space from my laptop, so I did not have to request access from the original website of eBird. I went on the MSUM class share website where the instructor uploaded it (\\msumstudents.mnstate.edu\classshare) to minimize the size of the data. .  Then I downloaded it. After the download, I  read the data into RStudio (R.version). I also read into RStudio an auk package with bird observations. I installed a cornel lab of ornithology with all the bird observations of the dataset using the function (remote::install_girhub). I loaded packages,  such as library("gridExtra"), library("lubridate"), library("psych"), library("readr"), library("dplyr") in the process.
